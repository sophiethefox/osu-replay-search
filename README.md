# osu! Replay Search


Program for searching through your osu! replays folder.
> [!WARNING]
> Loading replays on first run (without cache) may take some time depending on amount of replays, whether or not on an SSD, other hardware, etc. On a HDD with 14188 plays, it took my system `92s` to complete.

> [!CAUTION]
> This program is in an extremely volatile beta state. It is prone to breaking and may crash if used in an unexpected way. The program does not delete or overwrite any files other than cache (with a path specified) and settings. 

Features:
- Search most fields available in a replay and beatmap
- Use queries such as `mods=hddt`, `length<100`, `title="padoru / padoru"` etc.
- Drag and drop replay to search for other replays from the same map
- Open replay in folder

Planned:
- Double click replay to open in osu!
- BPM display & search
- Pass/Fail status
- Non-exact mod search (e.g. all plays with HD, regardless of DT, HR...)

<sub>Program has not been tested on Linux</sub>
